# BARZEL - React port

This repository is a React/Vite translation of the original static site at https://github.com/Leibo13/barel-website.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Notes:
- Assets (images) from the original repo should be copied into `public/assets/images` or `assets/images` at project root so the site images load.
- The accessibility widget and cookie banner persist preferences to localStorage.
